target add systemchatmessages for dedicated debug and ecm message:
	
#	added new functionfile
#/client/functions/Client_SystemChatMessage.sqf
#	added compile line to cti_CL_FNC_SystemChatMessage in 	||#removed,systemchat not works in this way
#/client/init/init_client.sqf line 250
	
	changed 
	/client/pvfunctions/localizemessage.sqf
		to handle this
			-added "chat" case
				syntax = ['chat',"exampletext"] remoteExecCall ["cti_CL_FNC_LocalizeMessage"];
			if you want use in scripts for debug and ingame feedback.
			exampletext can be list too,i made str in localizescript.
	changed or fixed 

/server/functions/server_ecmswitch.sqf
	with these new feature.so every client get ecm feedback in chat now,how it should be.
	
maybe revision needed,looks like all other stuff use commandchat because _commandChat = true;.reason unclear for now,
maybe that was fix for something.

todo maybe:add hint function too there,some gui layouts blocking systemchat or hint.dont remember which is blocked.
fixed: changed systemchat to groupchat,systemchat run maybe like local only.makes no different for debug,so thats it for now.

state: ecm message works,"chat" syntax input for debug too
