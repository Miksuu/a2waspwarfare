Game Guide: Commander's Handbook

# Glossary:
B = barracks, 
etc...

# Introduction
- This guide will help you to be effective as a commander in the game.
- It will cover the basic mechanics, and the strategy for the game.
- It will be a good way to learn the game, and to improve your skills.
- I made it not only because I want better opponents to play against, but also because I want to help players who are really struggling to be effective as a commander in the game.
- This way, we can have more engaging matches, and to have more fun playing the game.
- I will be updating this guide with feedback from the players, so if you have any suggestions, or if you think that something is missing, please let me know in the Discord server.
- Add some words for the players who have supported the server for a long time, and the haters.

# Commander description
- The commander will decide his team strategy
- Will take care of the HQ vehicle, and build bases with it.
- Placing these bases in strategic positions is crucial to the commander.
- Upgrade tech to make those bases more useful in terms of what they can produce

[autocomplete result, might be useful to some extent]
- The commander will be able to move the MHQ to a new location
- The commander will be able to deploy the MHQ to a new location
- The commander will be able to build a new bases
- The commander will be able to upgrade his teams tech
- The commander will be able to repair the MHQ
- The commander will be able to repair the bases [add complete section for this]
- The commander will be able to sell the bases
[generate more here as the guide progresses]

# Basic Mechanics for the Commander

- You should always have an active player commander. AI commander feature has been removed from the mission and replaced with "No commander" instead.
- If you see this, don't be afraid to take the commander role, if no one else is willing to! Hopefully this guide will help you to be effective as possible on this role!
- Having a commander is always better than having no commander.
- Commander gains significant more cash, based on how many towns you have
[explain this how much more, etc]


[Add to seperate section?]
- voting mechanics
- Player with most votes will win.
- However, if the vote goes even, no commander will be assigned
-add more here
- You are able to pass the commander with the vote menu to any other person instantly, instead of them having to vote for it.

## Mobile Headquarters (MHQ)

![LAV-25 HQ](https://github.com/Miksuu/a2waspwarfare/blob/CommanderGuideMarkdown/Guides/CommanderGuide/images/lav25hq.png)
![BTR-90 HQ](https://github.com/Miksuu/a2waspwarfare/blob/CommanderGuideMarkdown/Guides/CommanderGuide/images/btr90hq.png)

- The Mobile Headquarters (MHQ) serves as a mobile spawn point 
- Position it strategically to support frontline operations.
- Commander will be moving the MHQ and deploying it in good places to build bases (LAV-25(HQ) on BLUFOR, and BTR90(HQ) on OPFOR)
- This vehicle is the most important vehicle in your team, and moving it strategically is crucial to maintaining your team's position to get advantage in the economy, and denying the enemies chances to attack your towns and bases.

### HQ repair mechanics
- On the early stages in the game if the vehicle is destroyed, game is most likely lost.
- However, this depends on how many players you have on your team, be sure to check the advanced money transfer menu for your teams resources before deciding the sell and lose the game
{take image from here, add it to git}
- If you happen to lose this vehicle. You can always repair it with 25k supplies
and with the repair truck, 
- Mark is created automatically for your team for the lost HQ wreck

### Buying new HQ
- The alternate way to buy hq is to buy with 200 000 cash at the town center
- this can be only be done once.
- Buying hq will drop your all towns SV to 10, so you will have lower supply output for a while. If your supply upgrade is higher, this helps you recover from it.

## Base building

### Deploying HQ
 -The HQ can be deployed at any time,
 - aslong you have 500 supplies, and you are not near a town which you don't own [resistance, enemy town], or enemy base.
 - You should not deploy it inside a building at all, as this is against the rules, as it is with factories. However, you can wall it fully and place a camo net in top of it
 {insert image of fully walled hq here}

### Placing factories
- You can rotate the factories using the CTRL key. If you don't plan on using the spawn marker, make sure that the sign from the factory is on the road for LF and HF, and on open field for AF.
- So vehicles don't get stuck in a forest, for example.

- Optimal placement (outside of the line of the fire of the enemy, behind a terrain)
- Make sure that all of the production factories are accessible on foot
- Production factories like B,LF,HF,AF. must have a entrance. 
- Unlike HQ, CC, AAR must not have a entrance.
- On flat terrain, consider placement of the hq to be on the middle to be covered by the other factories [thanks copilot++, lmao]

### Base and factory limits
- Each team can only have 3 bases.
- Plan and place them wisely to cover key areas and support your team's movements.
- Each team can only have 2 production factories [list them here] and command centers.
- However, you can have 4 service points and AAR's

### Spawn Markers Usage
Position spawn markers on the base.
- non destructible
- allows factories to be built not near the roads
- Be sure to check that the spawn marker is not too far away from the factory.
- Also you can't build them if the enemy is close to your base, so be sure to check this before you place your factories.

## Defences
### Static defences
Place statics to defend critical points.
- List different type of statics here

### Walls and Barriers
Use these to create choke points and slow down enemy advances.
- List the walls here
- Be sure not to over do it, might limit your players and AI's mobility.
- Walls are created automatically when building a factory (you can disable this by using hotkey x)

# Shortcut Usage
## Hotkeys
Familiarize yourself with all command and build hotkeys to improve your efficiency.
[INSERT ALL OF THE HOTKEYS HERE]

# When the game starts
- As the game starts, a voting menu will popup 
{insert image here, the old one had outdated UI}
- You can always change the commander from wf menu by voting, [link to the basic mechanics, or remove this part]
- You can either build a base somewhere, or drive hq to a town to capture it
- Watch the position you started, and think about where you could build the base.
- Think about center control, stealth, and where you can capture the most towns to gain supply advantage.
- Refer to the [good places to build bases on section] for good places to build bases.

## Driving HQ to a town to capture it
- Alternatively, you can drive a hq near town and capture it, 600m meters is the town activation range.
- I'd not suggest drive closer, unless you have a terrain to use, so the enemy tanks or at infantry won't kill you and game won't end short.
- Try to drive it as close as you can to the camp.
- After capturing the town, you can always deploy hq inside it.
- Towns are good place for bases, due to the extra defences given by the town, and usually the buildings, where you can place your factories betwen them for extra cover for them.
- However, town bases do not provide any stealth for your base, as enemy could find it while capturing towns.

## Building the first base 
- Once the HQ is deployed, with 6000 supply start which is default, you can build:
- B, LF or HF and CC
- Make sure to not make a mistake of building building such as Aircraft Factory, Service Point or Anti Air Radar as they are not needed for the first base.
- LF will provide you with light vehicles and although you can get supply trucks with LF0 nowadays, it can be quite a big advantage in the early game if someone uses supply trucks to provide supplies for your base.
- HF will provide you with heavy vehicles such as tanks.

- Be sure to start with CC build, so it becomes ready as soon as possible, since usually before you can produce the good units, you will need to wait for some time for the upgrades to complete.
- This way you can complete the upgrades the fastest way.
- Place the CC near a road, if you want that AI supply trucks can access it.
- Place the CC the most towards the center of the map, so the coverage will be the best.
- Alternatively you can try to hide it if you want that it lasts for a very long time (if the enemy doesn't ever spot your base, and you sell it before they do)
- Depending of what you chose between LF and HF, as soon as the CC is ready, you can start upgrading that factory.
- If you chose to build the LF: upgrade to LF3 asap
- If you chose to build the HF: upgrade to HF1 asap
- When the upgrade is done, buy yourself one of the vehicles with only a gunner.
- Then fill up the queue with driver and gunner bots of the same vehicle, and go capture a town with it.
- If you chose a soldier slot, you will get significantly more units for this purpose.

- Next things to upgrade are definitely Gear 2 and barracks 1, or supply 1 if you are capturing towns very fast.
- Gear 2 and barracks 1, especially with LF3 since you'll have the supplies for it almost ready after upgrading LF3.
- This way you can get even more units and some basic gear for yourself.
- More on the [upgrade order section]


# BUILDING TYPES

[Make H2 and explain in detail]

## B
- Cost: 200 supply

## LF
- Cost: 600 supply

## HF
- Cost: 2800 supply

## AF
- Cost: 4400 supply

## Command Center
- Cost: 1200 supply
- Place near roads if your team does supply missions.
- 4800m circular range around the building, in all directions, including when you are high up in the sky.

- If you can hide one inside a base that's at the center of the map, that's good.
- For example if you sell a base that enemies have not spotted, they might never know that a CC was there, and might take them for a very long time to figure it out.
- Giving you free CC coverage from the center of the map for a very long time, or rest of the game.

## Anti Air Radar (AAR)
- Cost: 3200 supply

## Service Point (SP)
- Cost: 700 supply

- If moving from a base location (especially one that is near an airfield), if possible, be sure to leave a service point there, it might become handly later.





[WIP, FIX THE DESCRIPTIONS THAT THE LLM GUESSED]
# Detailed Upgrade Explanations

[GATHER DATA FROM ALL THE UPGRADE COSTS, RUN WITH GPT TO EDIT THE TEXT]

## Aircraft Factory
Allows the production of various aircraft to support ground operations and provide air superiority.
### Level 1
- Basic helicopters with lift capabilities uh60, mi8
- Blufor mv22 [check this?]
### Level 2
- Ambulance helicopters uh60, mi8
- Light attack helicopters such as ah-6j, uh1h
### Level 3
- First proper attack helicopters and attack jets
- a10a, su25a (but they don't have guided weaponry without easa, and even with this it's very limited)
- Upgrade easa with this level to make them a lot better to certain purposes
### Level 4
- A lot better attack helicopters and attack jets, such as a10c, su25t with guided weaponry
### Level 5
- The best air superiority fighters in the game such as F-35 and Su-34
- Best attack helicopters with most guided weaponry available in the game such as AH-1Z and Ka-52.
- They can also get sidewinder missiles. However these missiles are not as powerful as in the jets due to the balance changes made to our missions

## Airlift
Enables the transportation of units and supplies via air, increasing mobility and logistical flexibility.

- Very useful to get as commander to lift the hq to build another base. 
- With AF1 and this upgrade you can lift the HQ around the map.
- Very cheap upgrade combination to get
- You don't need to build helipad if you are near a airfield which has a hangar. With AF1, you can produce mv22 or MI8 out of the hangar.
- Just make sure that you have upgraded the airlift before buying the vehicle.
- The upgrade time is 30 seconds, so you can buy the vehicle and click upgrade after that. 
- If the vehicle production is ready when the upgrade is complete, you get the airlift capability

## Ambulance Range
Extends the operational range of ambulances, ensuring medical support can reach more distant units.

- Make sure to upgrade this especially if your team is utilising the ambulance and really needs the range.
- Depending on the use case, such as which town is being captured, or if a based is being attacked (depending on the terrain etc, how close they need to drive it), this might not be needed at all.

[Make a table instead of a list of levels]

Level 0: 250
Level 1: 350
Level 2: 500

## Ammunition

## ICBM
Enables the deployment of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, offering strategic long-range strike capabilities.
- Might be useful if you are very ahead and the enemy is defending their base on very advantageous position.
- Can suddenly become very good money sink and cause you to lose all of your money trying to nuke your way to victory, not advised.
[Maybe write more about this in some other section]
- Launch one when the enemy is able to surprise you with a counter base for example, and you would lose the game without it.

- Allows you to call a paratrop of a vehicle, or repair truck
- Might be useful if you have lost your HQ, and don't have access to a repair truck anymore.
- Also useful for parachuting a repair truck to build a service point for attack helicopters to rearm.

## Paratroops
Improves the capabilities and equipment of paratrooper units, enhancing their effectiveness in airborne operations.

[Go through the each of the paratrooper units and explain them in detail, make notes]

## Supply

- Increases the rate by which the towns gain supplies
- When you are capturing towns (especially the big SV ones) early game, this upgrade can be very beneficial to boost them to their max SV value as soon as possible
- Useful if you just bought a new HQ, to get them back up as soon as possible.

[TEMP, MAYBE NO NEED TO DESCRIBE EACH OF THE LEVELS]

### Level 1
[INSERT LEVEL DESCRIPTION HERE]
### Level 2

## UAV
Enables the deployment and use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for reconnaissance and support missions.

- Currently BLUFOR uav is very useful when there are not a lot of anti air around, since it gets hellfires.
- OPFOR uav, not so much.

# Income and money management

## Slots
- Even though soldier slot is recommended for the commander since you can get so many units to for example act as spotters for you, engineer slot can be good too.
- If you selected an engineer slot, you can salvage vehicles with the scroll menu.
- This can be very useful especially if your base is under attack, and vehicles are being destroyed left and right
- Remember to send the money back to your team though.

## Resource Allocation
- artillery
- at soldiers
- air
- defences

## Sharing for the team
- This is useful since as commander you get more money.
- Be sure to check the menu to make sure that your teammates have enough money to buy units they need {insert image here}

[Maybe remove this section, since it's not really needed if you keep spending you are most likely to gain advantage]
## Saving for Critical Moments
Keep a reserve of resources to react to unexpected threats or capitalize on enemy weaknesses.

# Situational Awareness

## First contact
- Track where their units players are moving
- Will be useful for decision making in regards moving the HQ

## Using Spotters
- Deploy spotters to gather intel on enemy movements and positions.
## Adapting Tactics
- Adjust your strategies based on the information provided by spotters to outmaneuver and outthink the enemy.

## Using helicopter/plane radar
- spotting possible HQ lift {insert image here}

# Dealing with Team Losing Motivation
## Boost Morale
Encourage and communicate positively with your team to keep spirits high.
## Efficient Resource Use
Make the most of scarce resources.
## Comeback Strategies
Focus on defensive plays and capitalize on enemy mistakes to turn the tide.
- turtle a bit, if you fall back and for example build in a city, the enemy might get bored if you defend well against their attacks
- Although be careful, they might send you an ICBM to crush your dreams of winning the game. More on that in the [Nuclear Warfare section]

# Common Base Positions
## High Ground
Provides a tactical advantage with increased visibility and defense.

## Central Locations
Ideal for quick reinforcement and support.
- Insert positions for Chernarus and taki here with {images}

## Flanking Positions
Useful for attacking the enemy from unexpected angles.

# Choosing Base Positions
## Based on Situation
Evaluate the current battlefield dynamics and choose positions that maximize your strategic advantages.
## Resource Proximity
Ensure bases are near to towns to streamline your supply chain.
- supply mission, cc placement near road

# Tactics
# Build a Counterbase
Relocate your HQ to quickly set up a counterbase in response to enemy movements.

- counterbase examples
- What happens when it becomes a counterbase war?

## Airbases
Utilize airbases for rapid deployment and air superiority.
- It might be a good idea to have one air base in the end game
- Since you can build three bases, but factories are limited at two.
- Not all bases need aircraft factory, however service point on all of them is a good thing to have in the endgame
- Not all airbases need to be on the actual runways, you can place them anywhere you want.
- make an {image} of the airbase placement, roads, etc. where light aircraft can take off from

# Strategy
## Evaluating Position
Regularly assess your current position and available resources to make informed decisions.
## Upgrade Order
Prioritize upgrades that will provide immediate benefits while planning for long-term growth.
## Risk Management
Weigh the risks and benefits of aggressive actions versus defensive plays.
## Calculated Aggression
Strike when the odds are in your favor and avoid unnecessary risks that could lead to significant losses.
## Nuclear Warfare
Use nuclear warfare to destroy enemy infrastructure and capital.
- see the video on the Taviana example
- explain how to act in situation (lift hq asap, gain high ground etc.)


# Conclusion
- Keep on practising
- If you are a new commander, it's a good idea to practise when server is not very populated.
- You can always pass the role later to more experienced commander if you feel unconfortable on continuing, but don't be too afraid to fail.
